I made these from the lesson vocabulary lists on Lifeprint. I have tried to keep
to the vocabulary relevant to the lesson, despite some of the vocabulary pages
containing other signs.

For example, [FLY] has FLY-airplane, AIRPLANE, BIRD-in-flight, FLAP-WINGS,
FLYING-INSECT, etc.

When there are multiple versions of a sign, e.g. [BACKPACK], I have chosen one
that seems to be commonly used by Dr. Bill, e.g. BACKPACK (A-hands version), and
made only that card two-way. It will show up in Anki as a text card “BACKPACK
(A-hands version)” and as a video card. Other BACKPACK cards will only show up
as video cards — they’re intended to train you to recognize the signs.
