### [stopwatch.mp4](stopwatch.mp4)

This is a screen recording I made of Yusuf Sezerâ€™s [analog clock demo][] after
modifying it (in the web inspector) to have a second and sub-second hand like a
stopwatch. [The original code][analog clock code] is available under an [MIT
license][analog clock license].
