### [stopwatch.mp4](stopwatch.mp4)

This is a screen recording I made of Yusuf Sezerâ€™s [analog clock demo][] after
modifying it (in the web inspector) to have a second and sub-second hand like a
stopwatch. [The original code][analog clock code] is available under an [MIT
license][analog clock license].

I added a repeating tone to it with a command like the following:

    ffmpeg -y -i silent-stopwatch.mp4 \
      -filter_complex "aevalsrc='sin(5*2*PI*t)*sin(220*2*PI*t)':d=5.0167[a]" \
      -map '0:v' \
      -map '[a]' \
      test-decks/good/media/stopwatch.mp4
