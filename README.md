# Build flashcard decks from text files containing YouTube URLs

Yanki makes it easy to build and maintain video flashcard decks. It can export
decks to [Anki], or it can display flashcards in a simple web UI that can be
hosted on any web server.

Flashcards can use media from local video or image files, YouTube, or any other
source [yt-dlp] supports.

## Installation

You will need `ffmpeg` installed to use Yanki. On macOS, install it from
[ffmpeg.org] or with [`brew install ffmpeg`]. On Linux or Windows, try
installing [yt-dlp’s ffmpeg].

I recommend using [`uvx`] run Yanki. `uvx` is part of [uv], which can be
[installed][uv install] a number of ways, but it’s probably simplest to install
`uv` through your package manager, e.g. [`brew install uv`] on macOS.

## Quick start

Create a simple deck file, e.g. `basic.deck`, to define your flashcards:

```yaml
title: Basic ASL phrases
more: md:From [Lifeprint](https://www.lifeprint.com/)
audio: strip

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHPszRvL9pg What is your name?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8cpOVeKZ4 Are you deaf?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqKENRGkOUQ Are you a student?
```

### Web flashcard UI

    uvx yanki serve-flashcards --open *.deck

The `--open` flag will open your web browser to the correct URL on macOS and
some Linux distributions (requires [xdg-utils]). If that doesn’t work, you can
just open http://localhost:8000/ in your web browser.

You can also save the web UI into a directory and serve it from any web browser:

    uvx yanki save-flashcards my-export-dir *.deck

### Anki export

On macOS and some Linux distributions, you can make `yanki` open Anki and start
the import of the new deck:

    uvx yanki -v update basic.deck

Otherwise, you can make it build an `.apkg` and then import that into Anki:

    uvx yanki -v build -o basic.apkg basic.deck

## Deck file format

There is a reference for the deck file format in [REFERENCE.adoc][].

### Examples

The [`asl/`][asl] directory contains example `.deck` files that can be used to
build a deck for the vocabulary and phrases in each [Lifeprint.com ASLU][LP]
lesson. Its [README.md][asl] briefly explains how the signs were chosen.

> [!TIP]
> If you are interested in learning American Sign Language, please see Dr. Bill
Vicar’s [Lifeprint.com ASLU][LP]. These decks can help you, but they cannot
replace the Lifeprint lessons and vocabulary pages.

> Plus, Lifeprint is full of Dr. Bill’s humor.

## Command usage

This is a Python package that can be run with [`uvx`]. The most common usage is
probably just to build your decks and import them to Anki. That’s as simple as:

    uvx yanki update *.deck

You can see all the commands and options with `--help`:

```
❯ uvx yanki --help
