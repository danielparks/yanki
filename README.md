# Build Anki decks from text files containing YouTube URLs

```
poetry install
poetry run yanki asl/lesson-01.deck
```

That will produce an `asl/lesson-01.apkg` file.

### Example deck file

```text
title: Lifeprint ASL::Phrases::Lesson 01
tags: lesson_01 phrase
audio: strip

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHPszRvL9pg YOU what-NAME?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyfRF3TeLPs YOUR NAME?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8cpOVeKZ4 DEAF YOU?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqKENRGkOUQ STUDENT YOU?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYvy_O_hhfw YOU UNDERSTAND THEM?

# You can extend a line by inserting tabs or spaces before any text:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wskcwTX27RU
  INDEX-[that-person] WHO?

  (Who is that person?)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0nVGVuHHB8 AGAIN, NAME YOU?

# These cards are similar, but distinct:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Kvv6FpF348 YOUR TEACHER what-NAME?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7pOg8YbCU YOUR TEACHER NAME WHAT?

# You can change tags used for future tags at any time:
tags: lesson_01 vocabulary extra

```

### Note GUIDs

Anki uses the GUID (Globally Unique ID) field to identify notes for update.
Yanki generates GUIDs based on the deck ID (generated from the deck title), the
video URL, the clip of the video (e.g. `@0:01-0:02`), and the direction of the
note (e.g. `<->`).

You can customize how the GUID is generated with the `note_id` configuration:

    # Default:
    note_id: {url} {clip} {direction}

    # Only use the text "question":
    note_id: {question}

The deck ID is always included. Leaving it out would not be very useful; if you
import a note in deck New that has the same GUID as a note in deck Existing, the
note in Existing will be updated but will stay in deck Existing. Anki wonâ€™t give
a warning.
